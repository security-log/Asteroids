# Asteroids

This project is a basic recreation of the classic arcade game [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid) using Python and the [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library.

This Python-based game replicates the core gameplay of Asteroids. The player controls a spaceship that can rotate and move forward while shooting asteroids. The goal is to destroy all asteroids without being hit.

## Dependencies

The game relies on the PyGame library, which must be installed before running the code. To install PyGame, you can use:

```bash
pip install pygame
```



## How to Run

- Clone this repository.
- Install the dependencies.
- Run the main Python file to start the game.

```bash
python main.py
```

## TODO

1. Life System: Implement a lives system to allow the player multiple attempts.
2. Pause System: Add a pause functionality to halt the game.
3. Score System: Create a scoring system to track and display the playerâ€™s progress.
